### Requirements:
 - React Native >= 0.44.0

## iOS Installation

1) Install and link the module:
```
react-native install urbanairship-react-native
react-native link urbanairship-react-native
```

2) Install [cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)

3) Update the app's Podfile to include the Urban Airship SDK:
```
pod 'UrbanAirship-iOS-SDK'
```

4) Update your pods:
```
pod install
```

5) Open your apps project in the generated `.xcworkspace` file, add the following
capabilities:
  - Push Notification
  - Background Modes > Remote Notifications

6) Create a plist `AirshipConfig.plist` and include it in your applicationâ€™s target:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>developmentAppKey</key>
  <string>Your Development App Key</string>
  <key>developmentAppSecret</key>
  <string>Your Development App Secret</string>
  <key>productionAppKey</key>
  <string>Your Production App Key</string>
  <key>productionAppSecret</key>
  <string>Your Production App Secret</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

7) Optional. In order to take advantage of iOS 10 notification attachments, such as images, animated gifs, and
video, you will need to create a notification service extension by following the [iOS Notification Service Extension Guide](https://docs.urbanairship.com/platform/reference/ios-extension/#cocoapods)

## Android Installation

1) Install and link the module:
```
react-native install urbanairship-react-native
react-native link urbanairship-react-native
```

2) Create the `airshipconfig.properties` file in the applications `main/assets`:
```
developmentAppKey = Your Development App Key
developmentAppSecret = Your Development App Secret

productionAppKey = Your Production App Key
productionAppSecret = Your Production Secret

# FCM/GCM Sender ID
gcmSender = Your Google API Project Number

# Notification customization
notificationIcon = ic_notification
notificationAccentColor = #ff0000
```

## Enabling Notifications

Notifications by default are disabled to avoid prompting the user for permissions
at an inopportune time. For testing purposes, you probably want to enable Notifications
immediately to verify push is working:

```
import {
  UrbanAirship,
  UACustomEvent,
} from 'urbanairship-react-native'

...

export default class Sample extends Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    UrbanAirship.setUserNotificationsEnabled(true);
  }

  ...
}
```
